<p>North Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 &amp; 3, 2017.</p>

<p>We're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.</p>

<p>Our venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options within a short walk, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.</p>

<h2>The Conference</h2>

<p>North Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.</p>

<p>If a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.</p>

<p>Our goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.</p>

<h2>The Town</h2>

<p>North Bay Python's home is <a href="/about/petaluma">Petaluma</a>, a delightfully quaint dairy town, nestled on a river at the southern edge of California's Wine Country.</p>
