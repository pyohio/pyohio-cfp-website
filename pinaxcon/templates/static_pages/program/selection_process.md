## Phase one: ranking of anonymized proposal contents

During this phase, the program committee will score each proposal solely on the merits of its contents, without any identifying information or other knowledge about the speaker(s) proposing the talk.

## Phase two: identify-aware ranking and curation

The program committee will use the scored proposals in conjunction with speaker profiles to rank and organize a program meeting our goals for diversity of speakers and topics.

## North Bay Python's diversity goals

+ At least one-third (33%) of speakers should be not-men, and ideally at least half (50%).
+ As North Bay Python aims to serve the "tech-adjacent" and client services industries, at least one-fifth (20%) of speakers should be from professional backgrounds that are not the Silicon Valley or San Francisco startup/software industry.
+ People with disabilities should be represented in the North Bay Python speaker lineup.
+ Racial demographics of the speaker lineup should ideally reflect US and Bay Area demographics within some margin of error.
