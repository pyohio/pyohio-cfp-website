Pickle supports this out of the box, and that's great!</p>\n<p>This talk is intended for intermediate and expert Python programmers. It's expected that you have heard of the Pickle module before and that you know it's unsafe. We'll (quickly) go through how Pickle works at a Pickle VM opcode level. Then we'll show how you can get arbitrary code execution, followed by some more advanced exploitation techniques (e.g. how you can put other behavior in a pickle while keeping equivalent functionality; e.g. the pickle still turns into the object you were expecting). Finally, we'll talk about how we can make this safe again in the end anyway, culminating in the practical implementation I have open sourced. </p>\n<p>If I have time (big stretch for the talk, but maybe not for the hallway track), I'll show techniques for how to attack Pickles that are \"protected\" by malleable encryption schemes like AES-CTR.</p>",

They wanted a tournament management tool that could help them organize, run, seat, and rank players in their world championships and several local qualifying events around the world. Most of the application was straightforward but they also had a very specific seating problem, and after doing some investigation I learned that their specific requirements made the task an NP-hard problem. The problem is this:\r\n\r\nGiven some number of players. Generate a number of tables where each table has 4 or 3 seats. Then from round to round seat players in such a way so that A) no player plays in the same seating position they previously sat in, and B) no player plays against someone they played against previously. Players should be seated as fairly as possible from round to round, and where there is a perfect solution the algorithm should arrive at it, and when there isn't it should arrive at the \"fairest\" solution possible. It should be able to handle any arbitrarily large number of players, and should run in seconds.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'm going to talk a bit more about this specific problem and how I solved it using Python. I will walk you through my different attempts and thought processes while attempting to develop a good solution. You will walk away with a process and framework to solve your own difficult problems and develop a scientific mindset that can help lead you to new discoveries.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will present how the algorithm works, and make suggestions to how it can be applied to solve other similar types of problems.

Picture the string we are searching as a line of tiles, (like those in scrabble), where the character each represent has been routed into its surface.\r\n2. This lets us talk about the two categories of places a regex start or continue a match:\r\n   1. At a character specified in the regex: (modeled by a vacuum-formed sheet of plastic whose profile can nest in the character\u2019s incised relief).\r\n   2. At a position called an anchor, specified in the regex: (represented by the insertion of a strip of plastic into the crack between tiles)\r\n      1. Note: whether a give \u2018crack\u2019 matches the given anchor is determined by what is to its left and right; more specifically, the categories they belong to, i.e. whitespace, printable, alphabetic, numeric, eol,  buffer-wall, etc.\r\n3. This model lets us illustrate how the regex engine goes about making a match; e.g., if our pattern wants to match \u2018ABC\u2019, and our string contains \u2018ABD\u2019, we slide along a piece of plastic with a  \u2018A\u2019 profile, from the start of the buffer to where we encounter the \u2018A\u2019 tile. The plastic will sink into \u2018A\u2019 tile, allowing us to swing down \u2018B\u2019 plastic that is taped the the right edge of \u2018A\u2019 overlay which also sinks down flush matching the \u2018B\u2019 tile.  When we try to swing down the next taped on plastic overlay, \u2018C\u2019, it crashes into the surface of the \u2018D\u2019 tile and instead levers out the \u2018B\u2019 overlay, which levers out the \u2018A\u2019 overlay and gets us back to sliding along the \u2018A\u2019 overlay looking for the next place to pause and try for a match.\r\n4. At this point we introduce SRL, (below), then show how its patterns translate into Python regex\u2019s, then we return to this model and extend it to cover all the different regex \u2018atoms\u2019 we can now write.\r\n5. This \u201cTile and Overlay\u201d model provides a visual metaphor to see how the regex engine works, but there are no tiles and overlay chains in the computer, there are only strings of bytes and double-bytes, (if we are talking UTF-8), so we briefly introduce a model that use height to represent characters.  This lets us talk about Unicode strings, and hints at the kind of optimizations compiling regex\u2019s might allow Python to do.\r\n6. For the presentation, there will be a physical model to show the example in covered in point three above, but to make things manageable, we'll then switch to illustrations done in Skecthup, (maybe even animations).\r\n\r\n## SRL: Simple Regex Language\r\n\r\n1. SRL is what is known as a \u201cLittle Language\u201d, or a \u201cDomain Specific Language\u201d which are built to handle a small problem area.  In SRL\u2019s case, the problem is that of the unreadability of regex\u2019s, and that each language has a different way of writing them.\r\n   1. You\u2019d think we could skip this as we are only concerned with Python here, but it is useful to have this level of abstraction, even if you only do Python. You are likely to find that your editor uses a different flavor of regex\u2019s.\r\n1. An overview, live demos, and documentation can be found at the project\u2019s website, <https://simple-regex.com>.  I won\u2019t duplicate them here,I\u2019ll just say that the exposition of what we need for this talk will follow this source material, and include a SRL to Python cheat sheet that covers their translation and how they are expressed in the \u201cTile and Overlay\u201d model.\r\n1.

Participants will be provided with a Circuit Playground Express microcontroller board to use. We will be using Mu as our code editor - Mu is an editor that has the serial REPL and a plotter built in, and makes getting started with CircuitPython quite easy. This beginner-friendly tutorial will cover what CircuitPython is and why you would use it. I will discuss the community built around CircuitPython and the compatible hardware. Then we'll cover how to install and update CircuitPython on the Circuit Playground Express board, creating and editing code, installing Mu, the serial console and the REPL, and how to install libraries. Then we will begin working with code. There will be a series of examples that utilise the various sensors, lights and switches built into the Circuit Playground Express board. We will start simply with the CircuitPython \"Hello, world!\" Then we will use the plotter in Mu to graph the data live from a few of the sensors. Next, we'll begin exploring the various other inputs and sensors on the board. From there, we'll build on the concepts learned, combining them as we go to eventually build a light up, capacitive touch tone piano.

Reproducibility improves the transparency of your analysis and therefore makes your results more resistant to misinterpretation.   </p>\n<p>Python and, more specifically, Jupyter Notebooks enable workflows to be reproducible with very little overhead. Due to these characteristics, Jupyter Notebooks are the current medium for most data science work.<br />\nOne of largest problems with switching to a reproducible workflow is amount of time you need to sink into converting to the new workflow. I will demonstrate how a data analysis workflow can be modified using python libraries and Jupyter Notebooks.</p>",
